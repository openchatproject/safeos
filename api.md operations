# group `operations` 

A set of valid comands for mutating the globally shared state.

An operation can be thought of like a function that will modify the global shared state of the blockchain. The members of each struct are like function arguments and each operation can potentially generate a return value.

Operations can be grouped into transactions ([transaction](#structeosio_1_1chain_1_1transaction)) to ensure that they occur in a particular order and that all operations apply successfully or no operations apply.

Each operation is a fully defined state transition and can exist in a transaction on its own.

Design PrinciplesOperations have been carefully designed to include all of the information necessary to interpret them outside the context of the blockchain. This means that information about current chain state is included in the operation even though it could be inferred from a subset of the data. This makes the expected outcome of each operation well defined and easily understood without access to chain state.

Balance Calculation PrincipleWe have stipulated that the current account balance may be entirely calculated from just the subset of operations that are relevant to that account. There should be no need to process the entire blockchain inorder to know your account's balance.

Explicit Fee PrincipleBlockchain fees can change from time to time and it is important that a signed transaction explicitly agree to the fees it will be paying. This aids with account balance updates and ensures that the sender agreed to the fee prior to making the transaction.

Explicit AuthorityEach operation shall contain enough information to know which accounts must authorize the operation. This principle enables authority verification to occur in a centralized, optimized, and parallel manner.

Explicit Relevant AccountsEach operation contains enough information to enumerate all accounts for which the operation should apear in its account history. This principle enables us to easily define and enforce the . This is superset of the [Explicit Authority](#group__operations_1defined_authority)
