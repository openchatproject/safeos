#/ @title A facet of KittyCore that manages special access privileges.
#/ @author Axiom Zen (https://www.axiomzen.co)
#/ @dev See the KittyCore contract documentation to understand how the various contract facets are arranged.
class KittyAccessControl:
    # This facet controls access control for CryptoKitties. There are four roles managed here:
    #
    #     - The CEO: The CEO can reassign other roles and change the addresses of our dependent smart
    #         contracts. It is also the only role that can unpause the smart contract. It is initially
    #         set to the address that created the smart contract in the KittyCore constructor.
    #
    #     - The CFO: The CFO can withdraw funds from KittyCore and its auction contracts.
    #
    #     - The COO: The COO can release gen0 kitties to auction, and mint promo cats.
    #
    # It should be noted that these roles are distinct without overlap in their access abilities, the
    # abilities listed for each role above are exhaustive. In particular, while the CEO can assign any
    # address to any role, the CEO address itself doesn't have the ability to act in those roles. This
    # restriction is intentional so that we aren't tempted to use the CEO address frequently out of
    # convenience. The less we use an address, the less likely it is that we somehow compromise the
    # account.
