# Creating Your First Python Smart Contract

### Running PyEos

Open a terminal, cd to [PROJECT_DIR]/build/program, run the following command

```
./pyeos/pyeos --manual-gen-block --debug -i
```

If it's the first time you start PyEos, PyEos will create a test wallet for you, which placed in data-dir/mywallet.wallet, and then console will print the wallet password as below:

```
wallet password: PW5JWE5g6RZ7Fyr2kmCphDqZo4uivdeGpUpndgFZ52rsduhtf9PRJ
```

Replace the password in programs/pyeos/initeos.py as shown below.

```
def init():
    psw = 'PW5K87AKbRvFFMJJm4dU7Zco4fi6pQtygEU4iyajwyTvmELUDnFBK'
```

So the next time you start PyEos, wallet will be opened for you, and PyEos is ready to run the test.

Also PyEos will import three testing private key to the wallet, which is useful for testing.

```
'5KQwrPbwdL6PhXujxW37FSSQZ1JiwsST4cqQzDeyXtP79zkvFD3',
'5JEcwbckBCdmji5j8ZoMHLEUS8TqQiqBG1DRx1X9DN124GUok9s',
'5JbDP55GXN7MLcNYKCnJtfKi9aD2HvHAdY7g8m67zFTAFkY1uBB'
```

Keep in mind that these private key should never be used in real account, otherwise you will lose all of your crypto property in the account.

Beside that, PyEos will create four important accounts for you:

```
eosio.bios, eosio.msig, eosio.system, eosio.token
```

and publish their smart contract on the testing blockchain. 

Although the above steps will never happen in the real world, but it's really provide a great convenience for testing smart contract. Thus save a lot of your precious time and make the development more efficient.

### Generating source code with sketch

Run the following command in PyEos console,

```
sketch.build('hello', 'helloworld', 'py')
```

That will create a helloworld directory under your current directory with hello as the testing account name. There are three file generated in the directory:

```
hello.py
hello.abi
test.py
```

Which hello.py is the Python smart contract source code, hello.abi is the ABI(Application Binary Interface) file for smart contract, test.py contains code for testing the smart contract, let's talk about it later in detail.

In addition, sketch can also create a wasm smart contract project for you, just type the following code in PyEos console, and the testing process has no difference with Python smart contract.

```
sketch.build('hello', 'helloworld', 'cpp')
```

### Testing


Now it's time to run your helloworld smart contract program. Type or copy the following command to the PyEos console:

```python
from helloworld import test
test.test()
```

You will see the following output on console in green words:

```
3289633ms thread-1   mpeoslib.cpp:63               print                ] hello,world
```

Congratulations, you have successfully run your first Python smart contract.

Now you can open hello.py for coding. Once it's done, just run test.test() again, 
there is no need to run other command to publish your testing smart contract, the smart contract will be automatically
republish to the testnet if it's been changed. You can also edit the testing code in test.py to test your smart contract. Once it's done, just run test.test() again, there is no need to run reload(test), PyEos has do the magic for you. That also works at the situation of adding a new function in test. 

There are a lot of examples in programs/pyeos/contracts. Some of them are still in development, if the example throws exception, then it's probably not done yet. Pick up an example you interest in and play with it as you want.

# PyEos api overview

#### eosapi.get_info
```python
info = eosapi.get_info()
info
```

```javascript
{
    "server_version": "00000000",
    "head_block_num": 127,
    "last_irreversible_block_num": 126,
    "head_block_id": "0000007fbd1ff82f29668dfa89d927a0510c657cce292c033496ccaacf04c12a",
    "head_block_time": "2018-05-06T07:57:44",
    "head_block_producer": "eosio"
}
```

```python
info.head_block_time
```
```
'2017-09-23T15:16:18'
```

```python
info.head_block_num
```

```
18624
```

#### wallet.create

PyEos will create a testing wallet for you the first time you start it, but you can also create other wallet wit wallet.create API

```python
psw = wallet.create('mywallet2')
psw
```

```
'PW5JCWXaGkA15s6th6AWCabHewuGASAtrUJjTWoL1Ybx6sG9QzrSb'
```
You can see you wallet now. The * behind mywallet means the wallet is unlocked.

```
wallet.list_wallets()
```

```
['mywallet *']
```
#### wallet.open wallet.unlock

```
wallet.open('mywallet2')
wallet.unlock('mywallet2','PW5JCWXaGkA15s6th6AWCabHewuGASAtrUJjTWoL1Ybx6sG9QzrSb')
```

#### wallet.import_key
Let's import the private key of inita. Please refer to [Setting up a wallet and importing account key](https://github.com/learnforpractice/pyeos#setting-up-a-wallet-and-importing-account-key) for more information.

```
wallet.import_key('mywallet2','5KQwrPbwdL6PhXujxW37FSSQZ1JiwsST4cqQzDeyXtP79zkvFD3')
```

#### eosapi.create_key

Create owner key

```python
eosapi.create_key()
```

```
{'public': 'EOS61MgZLN7Frbc2J7giU7JdYjy2TqnfWFjZuLXvpHJoKzWAj7Nst', 'private': '5JEcwbckBCdmji5j8ZoMHLEUS8TqQiqBG1DRx1X9DN124GUok9s'}
```

Create active key

```python
eosapi.create_key()
```

```
{'public': 'EOS5JuNfuZPATy8oPz9KMZV2asKf9m8fb2bSzftvhW55FKQFakzFL', 'private': '5JbDP55GXN7MLcNYKCnJtfKi9aD2HvHAdY7g8m67zFTAFkY1uBB'}
```

Import owner key

```python
wallet.import_key('mywallet2','5JEcwbckBCdmji5j8ZoMHLEUS8TqQiqBG1DRx1X9DN124GUok9s')
```

Import active key

```python
wallet.import_key('mywallet2','5JbDP55GXN7MLcNYKCnJtfKi9aD2HvHAdY7g8m67zFTAFkY1uBB')
```

#### eosapi.create_account
It's time to create an account, key1 and key2 are the public key you created before.

```
key1 = 'EOS61MgZLN7Frbc2J7giU7JdYjy2TqnfWFjZuLXvpHJoKzWAj7Nst'
key2 = 'EOS5JuNfuZPATy8oPz9KMZV2asKf9m8fb2bSzftvhW55FKQFakzFL'
eosapi.create_account('eosio', 'currency',key1,key2)

```

#### eosapi.produce_block

this command is used for generate a block when you are testing your smart contract.

```
eosapi.produce_block()
```

#### eosapi.get_transaction

we can test get_transaction now, replace 'f6c43148dfac54105031fbaf966958d36309dd94e665c506eb2769e43febedba' with the transcation id in the create_account output, you will notice the output is the same as the output of create_account command above.

```python
r = eosapi.get_transaction('f6c43148dfac54105031fbaf966958d36309dd94e665c506eb2769e43febedba')
r
r.transaction.signatures
r.transaction.packed_trx
```

#### eosapi.get_account

```python
info = eosapi.get_account('eosio')
info
```
```
{
    "account_name": "eosio",

            }
        },
        {
            "perm_name": "owner",
            "parent": "",
            "required_auth": {

                "accounts": []
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

#### eosapi.set_contract
Publish python smart contract to the blockchain

```python
r = eosapi.set_contract('hello','../../programs/pyeos/contracts/hello/hello.py','../../contracts/hello/hello.abi',1)
r
```

#### eosapi.get_table
