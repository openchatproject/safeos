/**
 * @brief Message-call/contract-creation executor; useful for executing transactions.
 *
 * Two ways of using this class - either as a transaction executive or a CALL/CREATE executive.
 *
 * In the first use, after construction, begin with initialize(), then execute() and end with finalize(). Call go()
 * after execute() only if it returns false.
 *
 * In the second use, after construction, begin with call() or create() and end with
 * accrueSubState(). Call go() after call()/create() only if it returns false.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * Executive e(state, blockchain, 0);
 * e.initialize(transaction);
 * if (!e.execute())
 *    e.go();
 * e.finalize();
 * @endcode
